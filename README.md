# co2tracker

### INTRO

Tracking the high levels of CO2 is essential for mitigating world problems such as climate change and air pollution. That is why my team and I created a personal carbon footprint application that also provides users with intelligent recommendations. *This project is built using Flutter, Firebase, GoogleMaps technology to contribute to 3 of 17* Sustainable Development Goals *(Sustainable Cities and Communities, Responsible Consumption and Production, Climate Action).*

### CALCULATOR 

When the user runs the CO2Tracker for the first time, he takes a test by entering keys for carbon footprint calculation. Here we focus on 4 main factors:

- Food expenditure (type of food consumed) in kg
- Transport distance (type of transportation) in km
- Recycle earnings (type of item recycled) in kg
- Energy consumption (electrical energy consumed per month) in kWh

As we finish calculating CO2 we are able to see our result which can affect on the lives of pinguins! At the top-right side you can see the numbers

### RECOMMENDATION

There is also a recommendation system which gives solutions to the poor air quality based on previously calculated carbon footprint.

### EDUCATION PET

CO2Tracker allows users to discover more about Carbon footprint through the game. The goal is to teach users to produce less carbon by changing their daily routine. User can change his pet and the status of the pet demonstrates the positive or negative progress of the user.

### LEADERBOARD

A user has an opportunity to compare his carbon footprint results with the help of Leaderboard where he can see rankings of his friends.  

### CONCLUSION

CO2Tracker offers a variety of functions for staying aware of carbon emissions, but more importantly, it is a tool for people to help the world to be a safe place for everyone.

Hardware:

Apart from that, we developed a hardware to measure the co2 emissions in real time and send the measured data through API.
